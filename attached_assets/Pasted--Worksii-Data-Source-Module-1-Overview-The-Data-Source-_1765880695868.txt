# Worksii – Data Source Module

## 1. Overview

The **Data Source** module is one of the major and most critical components of the Worksii platform. A data source represents a **dataset** that is required to create and execute campaigns. Without a valid and error‑free data source, campaigns **cannot be configured or launched**.

Worksii currently supports the following data source types:

* **Google Sheets**
* **CSV files**

Both data source types follow a similar creation and validation flow, with minor differences in how the data is uploaded.

## 2. Purpose of Data Sources

Data sources are used to:

* Store recipient or campaign‑related data
* Map raw data columns to system‑defined data types
* Validate data integrity before campaign execution
* Ensure only clean and structured data is available for campaigns

> **Important:** A data source must be **100% error‑free** to be available for selection in the campaign creation dropdown.

## 3. Creating a Google Sheets Data Source

### Prerequisites

Before creating a Google Sheets data source, ensure that:

* The Google Sheet exists and contains valid data
* The Google Sheet **sharing permission is set to “Editable”** or accessible by Worksii
* The sheet structure (column headers) is finalized

---

### Step‑by‑Step Process

1. Navigate to the **Data Source** module in the Worksii dashboard
2. Click on **Add Google Sheet**
3. Enter a **Source Name** (unique and meaningful)
4. Paste the **Google Sheets URL**

   * Ensure the sheet is shared with appropriate access permissions
5. Click on **Get Metadata Fields**

   * The system will fetch column headers from the Google Sheet
   * This may take a few seconds
6. Click **Next** to proceed
7. **Map Columns**:

   * Assign appropriate **Data Types** to each column
   * Apply required **Data Mappers** if needed
8. Click **Save**
9. Wait for the processing to complete
10. Once saved successfully, the data source will appear at the **top of the Data Source list**

## 4. Data Mapping & Validation

During the mapping stage:

* Each column must be mapped to the correct data type (e.g., phone number, text, numeric, etc.)
* Incorrect mappings may cause validation errors
* Mandatory fields must be correctly configured

The system automatically validates:

* Column structure
* Data type compatibility
* Mandatory field availability

## 5. Action Buttons (Post‑Creation)

Once a data source is created, the following actions are available:

### 5.1 Revalidate

* Re‑checks the Google Sheet data
* Identifies errors such as:

  * Invalid data formats
  * Missing mandatory values
  * Mapping mismatches
* Errors are displayed **near the affected fields** for easy correction

### 5.2 View Data

* Displays the actual data fetched from the Google Sheet
* Useful for:

  * Verifying uploaded content
  * Spot‑checking records
  * Debugging validation issues

### 5.3 Edit

* Allows modification of:

  * Source name
  * Column mappings
  * Data types and mappers
* After editing, **revalidation is required** to reflect changes

## 6. Campaign Availability Rule (Critical Note)

> **Until and unless a data source is 100% error‑free, it will NOT appear in the campaign data set selection dropdown.**

This rule ensures:

* Data integrity
* Error‑free campaign execution
* Prevention of runtime failures during campaign delivery

## 7. CSV Data Source

### Overview

CSV data sources follow a **similar flow** to Google Sheets with the main difference being the file upload method.

### Key Points

* CSV file is uploaded directly instead of providing a URL
* Metadata is extracted from the CSV file headers
* Column mapping, validation, and action buttons behave the same as Google Sheets

### Validation Rules

* File must be properly formatted
* Headers must be present
* Data must conform to mapped data types
* Zero validation errors are required for campaign usage

## 8. Common Issues & Best Practices

### Common Issues

* Google Sheet not shared properly
* Incorrect data type mapping
* Empty mandatory fields
* Invalid phone number or identifier formats

### Best Practices

* Finalize data before creating the data source
* Always run **Revalidate** after making changes
* Use clear and consistent column naming
* Verify data using **View Data** before campaign creation

## 9. Handover Notes

* Always verify data source status before campaign setup
* Ensure no validation errors are pending
* Revalidate data sources after external updates to Google Sheets
* CSV and Google Sheets behave similarly from a validation and usage perspective
