# Worksii – General Configuration

## Detailed User Manual & Handover Guide (Admin-Focused)

---

## 1. Introduction

The **General Configuration** module is a core administrative area in the Worksii platform. It contains **system-wide settings** that directly affect:

* Wallet funding and financial continuity
* Email communication branding
* Third‑party service integrations
* Secure API access

This document is written for **new administrators**, QA engineers, and operations team members who are onboarding to the Worksii system. It explains **what each configuration does, why it exists, how it behaves**, and **what can go wrong if misconfigured**.

> ⚠️ Any misconfiguration in this section can impact campaigns, payments, notifications, or external integrations.

## 2. Navigation & Access

**Dashboard → General Configuration**

Only users with **admin-level permissions** should have access to this module.

The General Configuration menu contains the following sub-sections:

1. Auto Top-Up Settings
2. Email Signatures
3. Firebase Project
4. API Client

Each section is explained in depth below.

---

## 3. Auto Top-Up Settings

### 3.1 What is Auto Top-Up?

Worksii uses a **wallet-based system** for executing campaigns (email, WhatsApp, messaging, etc.). Every campaign consumes wallet balance.

The **Auto Top-Up Settings** feature ensures that the wallet is **automatically recharged** when the balance becomes low, so that:

* Campaigns do not stop unexpectedly
* Messages are not partially delivered
* Admins do not need to manually monitor balance 24/7

---

### 3.2 How Auto Top-Up Works (Conceptual Flow)

1. System continuously monitors wallet balance
2. Wallet balance is compared against the **Minimum Balance Threshold**
3. If balance drops **below the threshold**:

   * Auto Top-Up is triggered
4. The configured **payment method** is used
5. Wallet is credited with the **Auto Top-Up Amount**
6. Transaction is logged in **Wallet Transactions**

---

### 3.3 Configuration Fields Explained

#### Minimum Balance Threshold *

* This is the **trigger point**
* Auto top-up happens only when balance goes below this value
* Accepts numeric values only

**Example:**

* Threshold = 100
* Wallet balance = 99 → Auto top-up triggers

#### Auto Top-Up Amount *

* Amount that will be added to the wallet per trigger
* Should be planned based on average campaign cost

**Best Practice:**

* Keep this high enough to avoid frequent top-ups

#### Select Payment Method *

* Payment gateway used for automatic recharge
* Currently supported:

  * Stripe

> Payment method must already be configured and active

#### Enable Auto Fund

* Master switch for the feature
* If OFF → No automatic recharge occurs (even if values are set)

### 3.4 Action Buttons

* **Save**

  * Validates inputs
  * Activates configuration

* **Reset**

  * Clears form values
  * Does not affect existing saved configuration

---

### 3.5 Common Mistakes

* Setting threshold too low → campaigns may fail before recharge
* Forgetting to enable Auto Fund toggle
* Using an inactive payment method

---

## 4. Email Signatures

### 4.1 What are Email Signatures?

Email Signatures are **reusable content blocks** appended to outbound campaign emails. They ensure:

* Brand consistency
* Professional communication
* Approved contact information

Signatures are managed centrally and reused across multiple campaigns.

---

### 4.2 Email Signature Listing Page

The listing table shows all created signatures with:

* Serial Number (SN)
* Signature Name
* Created Date
* Updated Date
* Actions

This helps admins quickly:

* Identify outdated signatures
* Audit usage
* Maintain consistency

---

### 4.3 Creating a New Email Signature

1. Click **+ Add Signature**
2. Enter a **Signature Name**

   * Use meaningful names (e.g., Marketing Team – Default)
3. Enter signature content

   * Name
   * Designation
   * Company
   * Contact information
4. Save

Once saved:

* Signature becomes available in email campaign setup

---

### 4.4 Available Actions

* **View** – Preview signature
* **Edit** – Update content or name
* **Delete** – Permanently remove (confirmation required)

⚠️ Deleted signatures cannot be recovered.

---

### 4.5 Impact on Campaigns

* Active campaigns will use the selected signature
* Changes apply to **future executions**
* Deleted signatures will not appear in campaign configuration

---

## 5. Firebase Project

### 5.1 Purpose

The Firebase Project section connects Worksii with **Firebase services**, which may be used for:

* Push notifications
* Real-time updates
* Event tracking

---

### 5.2 Configuration Overview

Admins are required to:

* Add Firebase project credentials
* Ensure correct environment setup (prod / staging)

---

### 5.3 Operational Risks

* Incorrect credentials → notifications may fail
* Environment mismatch → data inconsistency

---

## 6. API Client

### 6.1 What is API Client?

The API Client module manages **secure access credentials** for external systems that integrate with Worksii.

Examples:

* Third-party CRMs
* Data ingestion tools
* Partner platforms

---

### 6.2 Key Functions

* Generate API keys
* Manage active/inactive keys
* Control system access

---

### 6.3 Security Best Practices

* Never share API keys publicly
* Rotate keys periodically
* Revoke unused keys immediately

---

## 7. Role & Access Considerations

* Only Admin users should access General Configuration
* Changes should be logged and reviewed
* QA should verify configurations in staging before production

---

## 8. Handover Checklist (For New Admins)

✔ Review Auto Top-Up settings
✔ Confirm payment method is active
✔ Audit existing Email Signatures
✔ Verify Firebase credentials
✔ Validate API keys

---

## 9. Final Notes

General Configuration is **foundational** to system stability. Always treat changes carefully and validate after updates.
